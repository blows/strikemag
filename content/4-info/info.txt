Aboutus: 

STRIKE! is a collective working co-operatively against structural oppression and towards decolonised, intersectional, post-capitalist futures. Primarily producing a quarterly radical publication, we aim to be a platform for those involved in grassroots struggle, anti-oppression politics and the creative movements surrounding these issues.
Alongside the magazine we organise exhibitions, parties, workshops, and actions across London.

Submissions: 

We accept pitches and submissions! Please refer to this guide before submitting your work.

If you would like to write for the magazine, please send us an email with a pitch around 250 words to editor@strikemag.org. Please familiarise yourself with our site, the articles written before you and the politics we are interested in to make sure this is the right platform for you.  We are not interested in conservative ideas and/or academic jargon, our mission is to promote radical left wing ideas and critical thought that do not require a political science phd to comprehend,  please keep this in mind when submitting. The work we publish will always be anti-capitalist, anti-sexist and anti-racist and we strive to push for intersectional feminist ideals. Our mission is to promote pro sex work and trans inclusive feminism alongside decolonization, anti-imperialist and anti-albeist voices. 

Our printed issues are usually themed, if your submission does not fit into the current theme, it can be published on the website. Alongside  articles, we are also keen on design, art and video submission. The word count for article submissions is between 800-1500 words. We also accept interviews, design, illustrations and video content.
STRIKE! Is  run 100% on volunteers who believe in the need for a radical alternative media platform. We currently unfortunately can not pay you, although we are in the midst of fundraising so we can pay our contributors a small fee in the near future.  

Can’t wait to read, see and watch all your wonderful ideas. Look forward to hearing from you soon & don’t be shy!
