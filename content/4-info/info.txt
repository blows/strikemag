Aboutus: 

STRIKE! is a dissident collective led by women. We produce a quarterly magazine and organise events, discussions, parties, workshops, and actions across London. We are into rebellious grass-roots movements and committed to platforming the creative culture of these fights. 

Launched in 2012, STRIKE! is run on a shoestring by a small group of volunteers. As of 2017, we are able to pay our contributors. We believe our artists, writers and illustrators should be paid for their work because working for free sustains privilege. 

STRIKE! is member-supported and advertisement free. We aren’t funded by corporations, we’re funded by you. Help us keep publishing the important work we care about by subscribing.

Each issue of STRIKE! is themed. For each issue we will release a short editorial statement on that theme that you can respond to however you like, be it written, visual, or audio, etc. 

If you would like to contribute then please send us an email with a pitch of 200 words and a proposed first paragraph to editor@strikemag.org. Please familiarise yourself with STRIKE!’s content to make sure this is the right platform for you.
