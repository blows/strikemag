Aboutus: 

STRIKE! is currently a collective of 7 people, working co-operatively against structural oppression and towards decolonised, intersectional, post-capitalist futures. Primarily producing a radical publication, we aim to be a platform for those involved in grassroots struggle, anti- oppression politics and the creative movements surrounding these issues.
Alongside the magazine we organise exhibitions, parties, workshops and co-ordinate actions across London.
