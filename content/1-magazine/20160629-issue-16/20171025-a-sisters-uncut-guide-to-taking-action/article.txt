Text: 

## Listen
Take the lead from those affected: survivors, service users, sector workers.

## Research
Use local knowledge. Solid statistics are a great start.

## Solidarity-Network
Are we organising intersectionally? Link up feminist, migrant solidarity, housing, anti-cuts, LGBTQ groups...

## Key Messages
Make them clear.

## Planning
* Logistics–Work out a plan of action.
* Access–As far as possible, make the space safe for sisters.
* Propaganda–Make actions look striking.
* Media–Get the message out.

## Take Action
Make sure sisters are briefed on their legal rights. Be friendly and supportive to new sisters. Have specific groups of sisters making sure everyone is okay.

## Tell The World
Share with social media, news outlets, the community...

## Debrief
Reflect, support, grow.

It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
—Assata Shakur
