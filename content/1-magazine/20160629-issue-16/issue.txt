Summary: 

‘There is a violence that dominates and a violence that liberates’, says the Dangerous Spaces collective. Debates about the role of violence has always been central to all revolutionary struggles. The threat of student anarchists vandalising party headquarters, mobs on the streets ‘looting’ and smashing up shops. But violence is also state sanctioned and exists around us, screaming, in every street and in every community. 

On benefit sanctions, precariousness and emptying the prisons.
