Summary: London is in the midst of a violent crackdown on ‘undesirable’ residents, cleansing the city to leave a playground for the rich.

*It’s a paradox that the places thought to be the most uninhabitable turn out to be the only ones still in some way inhabited. An old squatted shack still feels more lived in than the so called luxury apartments where it is only possible to set down the furniture and get the décor just right while waiting for the next move. —The Invisible Committee*

An almost invariable aspect of squatting in London is the ritualistic return to empty buildings with the words ‘protected by occupation’ emblazoned on the doors and windows. Perhaps there is also an accompanying assurance of the ‘24 hr’ nature of this security measure and warnings of operational CCTV and the prosecution that will likely follow any bold attempt at trespassing. We return in the often vain hope that some or all of this deterrence is dysfunctional or otherwise an empty threat. For squatters, the proliferation of guardianships in London is a daily affront to our capacity to live. This situation cannot be totally reduced to the material effect of the depleting number of buildings we can take over, but in fact represents a more far-reaching and sinister process; the ‘deep cleanse’ of this city and a crackdown on ‘undesirable’ residents in its matrix of social control.

> For squatters, the proliferation of guardianships in London is a daily affront to our capacity to live. 

It seems that a fundamental disagreement on what life in the city should be is played out in the guardianship/squatting opposition. To many, guardianship seems to encompass the popularly supported aspects of squatting, insofar as squatting is being recuperated in some discourses as a ‘reasonable’ reaction to the ‘housing crisis’. Guardianship is, after all, the use of empty space to house people, some of whom were squatters before. The fact is that for many, myself included, squatting is reactive only in the sense that it is a refusal of and a withdrawal from the system as a whole, not only the crisis. Different people come into it for different reasons, but so much of it can be characterised as a rejection of insipid social relations: the family and couple model, enforced work ethic, and the emptiness of modern friendships struggling to exist meaningfully under the pressures of neoliberalism. Squats can be spaces where we re-attach ourselves; in crews, in collectives, where new complicities and necessarily criminal friendships are forged. 

> It is possible to situate guardianships as one aspect of a the repressive complexes of our cities

Here we find the true meaning of the ‘empty’ space as the site for squats, not in its legal definition, which is arbitrary at best. No, empty in terms of  the infinity of possibilities, empty as in not a prearranged stage set for the nauseating theatre of this lonely metropolis. It is possible to situate guardianships as one aspect of a the repressive complexes of our cities, one designed to close and fill these creative voids and to deny their possibility at all. 

Browsing through the websites of ‘empty property managers’ such as Camelot Europe, it’s clear the security of ‘vacant property’ is only the surface of what they are truly offering. ‘Before’ and ‘After’ pictures are given prominent place. The ‘before’ shows peeling walls stained with tags, an upturned bed and knee-deep trash. Interestingly they display a neon green 24hr clock in the bottom corner, obviously implying the recording of the debauchery on CCTV. The ‘after’ image? A magnolia painted empty space with a white guy playing a uke, alone (as per requirement) in the middle of it. In the process they describe as guardian ‘vetting’ the same company demands: ‘full-time employment, no criminal record, UK nationality’ etc. Other companies like Guardians of London have similar requirements including ‘no parties’ and boasts of their ability to evict any sorry individuals who seek to break the rules with only 24 hrs notice.

This is the outline of an entire way of life; the skeleton of the totally gentrified subject. Isolated and hollow, obedient and frugal: humiliated, completely at the mercy of capital. Is this the enemy?

> Ultimately, the property guardian is on the side of the developers. Their ‘job’ as guardians, for which they pay fees not rent (waiving any legal rights as tenants), is to protect the property rights and interests of landlords. 

In conversations on the topic with friends over coffee, maybe with court papers spread on the table, the main thoughts that seem to be expressed are the unfortunate precariousness guardians face and their general status as ‘in the same boat as us’. Fellow ‘victims of the housing crisis’ worthy of support despite the strife their presence causes us. Certainly in encounters between guardians and squatters these sentiments have found their political grounding. But ultimately the property guardian is on the side of the developers. Their ‘job’ as guardians, for which they pay fees not rent (waiving any legal rights as tenants), is to protect the property rights and interests of landlords. 

Perhaps an overly reductive, simplistic and politically marketable conception of ‘social cleansing’ has blinded us to the subtleties and contradictions that characterise the coincidence between economic positioning and relations of power. But perhaps these same contradictions are the lines across which battle has to be drawn if we are to stop this city being sterilised completely.

My squat crew cracked a building recently. Inside, to our dismay, was the bed and some possessions of what we later found to be a guardian. Fortunately he did not work for a company as legally watertight as Camelot and when he came back that night and snitched to the police with the hope of evicting and arresting us then and there, he and the owner were told that going through the normal court process was, in this case, necessary. Some of us were still uncomfortable with shutting him out the place he had been ‘protecting’, but there is a double standard in this position. For it is almost a given, in my experience, that subsequent to an eviction of a squat it will become occupied by guardians almost immediately. Something tells me they don’t have the same debate about whether it is acceptable to turf out squatters to make way for them, the paying security guards of the property. 

This points to an internalisation of an ideology, that the way capital designates legitimacy still holds sway in ostensibly radical milieus. This is evident as soon we desert the caricatures of ‘squatter’, ‘guardian’ or even the idea of a ‘precariat’. By pinning any struggle to the materiality of what kind of space is opened up or closed during its course, the ground reveals itself. The traitors are unmasked, the enemies are made visible, our accomplices and friends rise from their obscurity in the labels and identities they are otherwise confined in.

> Gentrification is a way of organising space, it is private security companies patrolling empty shopping parks at night, streets studded with CCTV cameras, the re-marketing of our dissenting cultures of resistance into pacified museums of past radicalism. 

If gentrification is only thought of as the eviction of the ‘poor’ to make way for the ‘aspirational’ middle class, we forget the process that the mass eviction itself is a symptom of. Gentrification is a way of organising space, it is private security companies patrolling empty shopping parks at night, streets studded with CCTV cameras, the re-marketing of our dissenting cultures of resistance into pacified museums of past radicalism. Gentrification is the end of both genuine autonomy and meaningful relationships with each other; those not at the mercy of the vacuous recomposition of identity, where everything is processed through ever more exuberant and glassy spectacle, looming over a restrained, monitored and generally miserable reality. It is crucially an injunction to ‘stay quiet’, to not ‘trespass’ on what you don’t pay for, to remain vigilant during times of rising tension. To report any suspicious behaviour and let the police do their job.

It is worth comparing this issue with the radical ecology and anti roads movement that has existed in various forms across the UK for decades, but which the forces against gentrification today have largely grown out of. A key point of this struggle is the idea that the  process of ecological devastation is a conflict between forms of life. An attempt to tame wildness, to tarmac forests, to establish the perspective of staring out at untamed land and seeing only the blueprints and floor plan of a potential car park. The actions and moments that deservedly glimmer in memory today are the moments when the counter offensive was taken, when sites designated for ‘development’ were turned into sites of resistance where all who fought to keep land wild were themselves the subject of rewilding. The actions where space was seized, where the flow of things were, for a moment, interrupted; opening the way for subversive purposes.

> To those in the employment of property guardian companies, whatever our social similarities, never forget what you are ‘protecting’. Never forget that insofar as we are at war with a miserable way of life, you are an ally of the enemy.

I believe we need to continue where they left off. Fighting to defend specific areas of land from development was recognised to be only a manifestation of a war between irreconcilable ideas of what it means to live; so we must see gentrification as a war between the interrelated systems and processes working to organise and control space in the city, and those engaged in expropriating, liberating and communalising it. Regardless of which ‘radical’ or ‘alternative’ culture and identity we have cultivated, this is where sides must be taken. To those in the employment of property guardian companies, whatever our social similarities, never forget what you are ‘protecting’. Never forget that insofar as we are at war with a miserable way of life, you are an ally of the enemy.
