16 September, 2016. A South Korean shipping container company, Hanjin Shipping, goes into administration with debts of $5.5bn. The company has a fleet of 141 shipping containers, worth an estimated $1.76bn. It is the seventh largest container carrier and transports 100 million tonnes of cargo every year. Everything from Samsung electronics and Italian motorbikes to waste paper. It can't afford docking fees in ports, so many of its fleet and crew are stranded. Today, these ships sleep silently near land like dragons guarding cargo intended for shops elsewhere, a forgotten piece of infrastructure that failed to fulfil its mission.

21 October, 2014. Seven years after the publication of L'insurrection qui vient (The Coming Insurrection), a new text appears: A nos amis (To Our Friends).

The 100 or so authors of To Our Friends concern themselves with constituting a ‘force which acts’ rather than proposing a list of demands upon current political institutions, which are so clearly bankrupt. They keep to the 2001 Argentine rebellion's cry of: out with them all (Que se vayan todos!), but more specifically, they stick to the more forgotten second part of the slogan, which reads: ‘que no quede ni uno solo’ (and let not one of them remain). From a position of disgust with all that lies in front of us, they posit an ethical truth:

*If earthlings are prepared to risk their lives to prevent a square being transformed into a parking lot as at Gamonal in Spain, a park from becoming a shopping centre as at Gezi in Turkey, woods from becoming an airport as at Notre-Dame-Des-Landes, it's clearly because what we love, what we are attached to -- beings, places, or ideas -- is also part of us, because we are not reducible to a Self lodging for a lifetime in a physical body bounded by it skin, the whole entity being graced with a set of properties which this Self believes it possess. When the world is fucked with, it's we ourselves who are being attacked. (47)*

So, how to risk our life for a city that is being intractably fucked with? Notice that in every city there are miles and miles of that abhorrent thin, grey, metallic railing splayed about the city with its accompanying band of pneumatic drills and men in hi-vis clothing redirecting you. Soothing voices apologize for the inconvenience. 

The much-loved and short-lived Facebook group, Boring Dystopia, with its crowd-sourced photographs showing a venn-diagram of hyper-policing, computer failures and emotional boosterism in different forms across England, attested to Capital's thoroughly broken attempts at efficiency and automation. More importantly, it made clear what is now strikingly obvious: modernity and capital have ceased to coincide. In another desperate attempt to prove its speed, Camden right out to Amersham and up through the Midlands is about to be ripped apart for HS2, a high-speed train. A train that promises to deliver a few jobs to somewhere and promises the possibility of getting to Birmingham fractionally faster.

> As long as the prospect of a popular uprising will signify a guaranteed fall into scarcity of healthcare, food or energy there will be no strong mass movement.

It is possible to read To Our Friends as a general post-mortem for the insurrectionary defeats. Specifically after the movements of the squares, famously Occupy and Los Indignados, everywhere in Europe a certain despondency has set. Given the conditions of post-crash in the continent of rampant austerity, heavy state repression, corruption, privatization, gross inequality and so much else, resistance should go off like wildfire, and yet it has not. Each ‘anti-austerity’ protest has fallen to different instruments of power, whether they are financial or that of the police. Furthermore, the old link between the mandate of a parliament and the sovereignty of the populace has proved to be a false one. Giorgio Agamben's theory of a ‘state of exception’ is proven correct everywhere we look; as evidenced most recently by France's continual renewal of the ‘state of emergency’ until January 2017. 

Therefore, rather than situating the fight on the plane of the political, as the movements of the squares did, A Nos Amis suggests reorienting around the ethical. A ‘NO’ is sufficient to organize around, whether it be statements such as ‘there will be no high-speed train in the Susa Valley’ or ‘there will never be an airport in Notre-Dame-Des-Landes.’ 

By saying ‘NO’, these fights show what is at stake in a public works project and therefore how vulnerable they are. This realisation then opens up possibilities for the fight against capital since it is through ‘a high voltage-line, a freeway, a traffic circle, a supermarket, a computer program… a sewage system, an undersea cable, a fibre optic line, a data centre’ (84) that power works. Therefore, the fight for the city must be waged upon its infrastructure and its logistical flows. It's not sufficient to talk about which buildings to occupy, but rather which interstices to blockade. 

This is where the fate of Hanjin Shipping becomes significant. Even the minor successes of the Deliveroo strikers this summer gives a key to this: the movement of goods is a weak and vulnerable link in a series of endless logistical chains. It also has the advantage of being tangible physicality that is comprehendible and replicable. The whole thing must be brought back down to earth, after all, ‘all bastards have an address’. (75) 

One of the really genuinely good questions put to you from To Our Friends is pretty succinct: how far do you rely on the institutions and networks that you profess to hate? The testimony of Athens in December 2008 gives a snapshot of the moment when victory seemed to have arrived and also ‘taught us the meaning of the word “counter-insurgency” in a Western country.’ (132) They write:

*The banks were in pieces, the police stations under siege, the city in the hands of the assailants. In the luxury shops, they were no longer repairing the windows, which would need to be done every morning. Nothing the embodied the police reign of normality was untouched by this wave of fire and stones whose bearers were everywhere and representatives nowhere—even the Syntagma Christmas tree was torched. At a certain point the forces of order withdrew, after running out of tear-gas grenades. (131) *

And yet, Athens today is not the Athens of 2008. 

*So long as we can't do without nuclear power plants and dismantling them remains a business for people who want them to last forever, aspiring to abolish the state will continue to draw smiles. As long as the prospect of a popular uprising will signify a guaranteed fall into scarcity of healthcare, food or energy there will be no strong mass movement. (96) *

Without a concrete idea of what life in the city should be like, it's hard to see where victory comes from. In the dark, confused fugue of what revolution means, though, there is evidence that homo homini lupus (‘man is a wolf to men’) does not exist once the state disappears, such as at the ZAD in Notre-Dame-Des-Landes.

> The fight for the city must be waged upon its infrastructure and its logistical flows. It's not sufficient to think about which buildings to occupy, but rather which interstices to blockade.

With all this in mind, a widespread rent strike is a good place to start. Rent is everyone's problem, which is what gives it the potentiality to become common, to become part of what the spaces between everyone and how we form attachments. Removing the problem of working to pay a landlord will attack a hugely problematic aspect of living in a city: scarcity of time. Sharing the collective burden of social reproduction will perpetuate itself in a virtuous circle, giving more time to different projects such as medi-cabins, soup kitchens, self-defense classes and food production, which in turn will reduce the reliance on infrastructures of power within city spaces. We are not only against rent then, we are against the world that rent produces. Therein lies the radical aspect of rent strike's argument.

But the rent strike still contains a tacit complicity to the arrangement of an oppressor because the limit of its demands, as currently constituted, is for less exploitation, which is all it can create within the context of the city as it stands. What would it mean to disavow the relationship entirely and make non-payment an already accepted axiom? For example, in the occupation of Notre-Dame-Des-Landes, the idea of rent is pure fantasy, the idea that anyone could impose it would be met with laughter.

The city with its CCTV, police, smartphones and fatigued aliens will not be dismantled, simply as a result of sheer wishful thinking. Capital is already busy cultivating mega-metropolises like London, New York and Paris, built of desperate dreams and automated labour, with a few other cities able to attract tourists because of their cultural or historical curiosity. The rest of the world will become large detention centres with walls around them. There may be left a few sovereign rural rebels, fighting to keep their autonomous state from persistent police raids, persecuting and repressing them under the rubric of ‘eco-terrorists’. But wishful thinking does have its place in the laboratory of insurrection. For only by imagining new ways, consistencies can form. 

Last quotation then: ‘It's not the end, not even close. If you can fight, fight. Help each other. The war has just begun.’ (40)
