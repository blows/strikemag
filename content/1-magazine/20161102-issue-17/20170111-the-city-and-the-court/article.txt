I’m sitting in a corridor outside Court 8. There are several sounds: the beep of the metal detector gate as it catches someone’s keys; the rapid footsteps of bewigged barristers; Tannoy announcements telling ‘all parties in the case of …’ to hurry to court; swing doors tick-tocking back into place; trolleys of papers wheeled from room to room; an unanswered telephone on the witness desk. And the silent objects: banks of grey plastic chairs, in lines of three, screwed to the ground line the wood-panelled walls, a grey and pink marbled-effect tile floor. Inside the court: the omnipresent crown emblem, the judge, the jury, the ushers, the occasional press person, lawyers, police officers, the witness, the security guard and the defendants. And the public? Often absent. 

> The closer you get to the repressive state, the more you understand about control. Or the more you think you do.

The courtroom is both open and closed, the courthouse is both visible and invisible from the standpoint of the city and its subterranean links to the police station and the prison. But how can we understand the city if we do not know where these places are? How many of us could point to all the prisons in the city, all the courtrooms, all the police stations? A city is random, noisy chaos, but it is also order, division and separation, and the closer you get to the repressive state, the more you understand about control. Or the more you think you do.

In the courtroom, there is a public within the public, and another public that faces them, silently, in the form of the jury. One public is there in the role of support – family, friends (if you’re lucky) – and the other is a random collection of those on the electoral register. The one pins their hope on the other in a silent one-sided pact, examining unknown faces for signs of sympathy, empathy, kindness, understanding. You never actually know. Even a verdict one way or another gives you no real clue as to the process of decision-making, the inner life of the jury, this random set. Do jury members fall in love? Take instant dislike to one another? Go with what’s easier when it comes to the majority decision? Get bored and worry about how much work there’ll be to catch up with later on? Think about their kids? No doubt all of these things at one point or another. They may care very deeply about the case or they may not care at all. You will never know.

> Do jury members fall in love?

A city can be mapped and measured in sounds, objects, buildings, ideologies, signals, bodies, roads, green spaces, quantity of birds, insects, bones, cars, or anything else. We understand connections but we do not necessarily see connections, if we cleave too closely to the separation of sound, sight and touch. But there are institutions hidden in plain sight, and far more proximate to some than they are to others. A city to one person might be shopping malls, commuting, restaurants and to another, police harassment, the police station, the court, the prison. It’s still the same city. Certain buildings leap out at us and others hide, depending on our circuits of interest, our previous experiences, our desires for the future. There is a web, but where is the spider? Sitting outside court you start to realize that the spider is the web – there is not a spider and then a web, but rather the web is continuous with the lying in wait, with the ultimate capture. Being on bail, awaiting trial, the delays and pauses and complications of the trial itself, awaiting the verdict, the looming threat of imprisonment, these are the web, but they are also the spider, because they too are designed to do as much damage as they can, to punish you before you are eaten, to identify you, to entrench you deeper and more proximately to the predator who binds and, in the end, devours you.

We are today accustomed to thinking of webs without spiders, prisons that no longer need guards because the threat of surveillance is omnipresent, and, besides, it’s easier to get people to police themselves than it is to hire actual, outdated, real police. Only this didn’t turn out to be true, or is only half-true. The societies of control, as Deleuze and Foucault and others described them, do exist. We only have to think of the city as a network of CCTV cameras and screens and possible, but not necessary, eyes that judge and report on you to understand computers and phones as constant recording devices of one kind or another, registers of metadata, geolocation, emotion, desire. But the old forms of repression didn’t retreat behind screens, even they might rely on them more and more (and inside the courtroom, high-def footage of whatever incident is being tried comes to stand in for the prosecution argument). What we have is a situation in which older forms of punishment combine with contemporary technology to create a full-spectrum web of psychological and physical threat: what differs is how close on the web to the spider you find yourself. 

> The politics of fear has a grip on the adrenaline of the city.

While it is possible to map the city, or have institutions in place that map it 24/7, it does not mean that the city is fully controllable, whatever illusions are perpetuated by millions of all-seeing eyes and by hostile architecture that seeks to funnel cash-rich bodies into coffee shops and homeless people to a sleepless death. At the moment, the politics of fear has a grip on the adrenaline of the city and has filled in the space of fear with a whole list of ‘others’ – migrants, asylum seekers, the disabled, the poor, gangs. But is this an infinite list? What happens when the politics of blame and fear runs out of people to target? Or do we need to understand these hate-constructed collectives as cyclical names and objects that get resurrected whenever it is deemed useful? The entire point of the list is to avoid the accurate identification of those responsible for the destruction of social bonds, for poverty, for economic collapse. Misdirection makes us cynical when we should be angry: but getting a measure of the web should also reveal to us how flimsy it is.    

Part of the reason why it is sometimes hard to remember that the city is also the site of courts and prisons, as much as it is of parks and art galleries, is because these represent end-games, and we naturally shy away from thinking about worst case scenarios. These are places where bad things happen to other people, ‘bad’ people, and is there any better way of making someone look already guilty than shoving them in a glass box and getting various state forces to line up and shout at them? Every day the theatre of court plays out, in thousands of boxes, thousands of windowless rooms. There are more than 90 crown courts in England and Wales and 330 magistrates courts, each with multiple courtrooms. There are 23,000 magistrates and around 2000 judges. These are not merely static facts, but realities reproduced every second of every day, and the courtroom is not only where the state flexes its power, but where it reproduces its very nature – it makes its arguments and proves its point by sending people to prison. The state is the state is the state. It gazes at itself nowhere more than in courtrooms, where no other light is allowed in.

> What would it mean to shatter the ‘peace’ of the courtroom?

One of the strangest things about courtrooms is how quiet they are. Everyone speaks in a low, confusing burble, as if trespassing on a grave. Occasional outbursts of anger or joy at an acquittal are smacked down immediately and ushers and security guards are mobilised to keep order. What would it mean to shatter the ‘peace’ of the courtroom? To shout so loudly that the glass of the judge’s water jug and the panes of glasses behind which defendants stand shatter into a million pieces and disappear from the earth? To think of a city without police, courts and prisons, without immigration centres on the periphery, without omnipresent fear and surveillance? A city where parks and art and social life are not havens to escape to if you can, but are everywhere, are normal, are not the flipside of the restrictive city, the city that captures you, and where the only spiders are the real ones, gently weaving webs in the autumnal sun.

Summary: Do we understand what a city is if we do not know where the courthouses, police stations and prisons are?
