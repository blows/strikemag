## What is a rent strike? 

A rent strike is exactly what it sounds like: not paying your rent. Whether in protest at the cost, conditions or – for the most unlucky – both, rent strikes have been a highly effective tool utilised by campaigns around the world. Refusing to pay rent provides tenants with a real and tangible power to resist greedy landlords and aggressive gentrification. Rent strikes enable us to stand up to the capitalist invasion of our homes and neighbourhoods.

One of the most successful examples is the 1915 Glasgow rent strike, organised by working-class women to protest against rent hikes, which led to rent controls being introduced across the city. In 1973, forty-five universities in the UK were on rent strike, protesting the government’s plans to cut student grants. 

## Why do we need student rent strikes? 

Universities have become debt factories. Students are the cash cows of their universities and the 2010 tuition fee hike was part of a broader restructuring of university funding. While students get deeper and deeper into debt, universities channel this cash directly into funding their vanity projects. 

Put simply, in this current hyper-competitive system, universities need money, which they get through enormous loans. Case in point, UCL just obtained the largest loan ever taken by any British university to fund the construction of their new campus in Stratford. These loans are made possible by universities having a reliable income from new students every year. This is motivated by an unceasing need for more new students and to attract more capital investment and in order to do so, universities are building flashier campuses.

These new, shiny buildings, these physical manifestations of the neoliberalisation of our higher education, are not cheap. It all becomes a beautiful, symbiotic circle, rather like a snake devouring its own tail, while burning the hopes and dreams of thousands of young people who can no longer afford to go to university. 

> In just nine years, student rents in London have gone up over 200%. The average student room in halls in London is now £226 per week. 

According to a recent NUS survey, 78% of university students have experienced mental health problems in the last year. Students are under immense financial stress and access to higher education for working class young people is diminishing. We need ways of fighting back and we need them now. 

It is easy to feel demoralised when confronted with institutions that hold enormous wealth and influence. Radical student movements have failed to build momentum since the failures, disappointments and repression of the 2010 riots and protests. However, rent strikes are one answer: they interrupt the flow of money to universities and they call attention to the human cost of the marketisation of higher education. 

> The beauty of the rent strike is in its simplicity: joining a rent strike is as easy as not paying your rent.

## Do rent strikes actually work? 

Student rent strikes are in many ways much easier to mobilise than rent strikes in the private rental sector. Students living in halls share a space and a landlord, making it more convenient to organise. It’s also just a little bit harder to justify rents that make your tenants’ lives a constant struggle when your landlord is the one in charge of looking after their wellbeing. 

During the UCL rent strike, there were over a thousand students on strike last spring, and they won concessions of over £1,000,000. So yes, rent strikes work, because they hit universities where it hurts: money and reputation. It exposes universities as greedy and elitist institutions. 

If you can mobilise students, if you can make enough noise and cause enough grief for your university management, if you can make sure that the university knows how bad they would look if they chose to evict or sanction striking students, you stand a chance of winning. 

## How do I get involved? 

Step 1: Set up Rent Strike on campus or support an already existing campaign in whatever way you can. Check out the Rent Strike Facebook page to find out if students are already organising on your campus. If you’re not a student, join your local tenants’ association or find housing campaigns in your area. While student rent strikes are easier to mobilise and involve less risk for strikers, there is no reason why rent strikes could not happen in the private sector as well. 

Step 2: Don’t pay your rent.

Step 3: Help resist evictions. Join protests. Spread the word. Strikers need to know that even in their precarious situation, they will not be abandoned. 

Housing is the struggle that unites us all. We need to support each other and build networks of solidarity between those in student accommodation or council housing and those renting privately. 

Rent is everyone’s problem. Now is our time to fight.
