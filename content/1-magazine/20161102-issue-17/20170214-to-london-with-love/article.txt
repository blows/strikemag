Text: 

London is mine.

Whore City, I fell in her lap once
and now for all time she's mine.

Her arms open for all admirers,
they fall for her fall in her

they make her theirs. And then they perish
all in her cruel attractions

her painted face and her smoky glow,
they perish. They've made her theirs.

London is theirs.

Who went up like smoke for her smokiness –
they laid her streets tar and slick

they built her walls each brick by brick
they swept her floors lickety-lick

they drove her trucks and cured her sick
they did not miss a single trick –

and went up like smoke for her smokiness.
They made her beautiful.

London is ours.

We made her beautiful, us stragglers,
and she shines and knows and opens her arms.
