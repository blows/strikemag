The Squatter's Handbook is produced by the Advisory Service for Squatters (ASS), which recently celebrated its 40th birthday. The ASS collective has accumulated a great deal of knowledge over the years and they know a great deal more about the laws relating to squatting than most lawyers. Some squatters have become familiar with the (sometimes archaic) workings of the civil court system, and are relatively expert at arguing points of law when it comes to Possession cases. Others have much less experience and can be very vulnerable to the law. This handbook aims to inform and empower squatters. 

A lot has changed since the 1970s. Indeed, a lot has changed since the 13th Edition of the Handbook came out, in 2009. Squatting is still legal, but not in all circumstances. A new criminal offence was introduced (within the LASPO Act ) in 2012, to prevent people from squatting ‘residential’ buildings with the intention of living in them. 

How the new law would work was not clear at first. It is still possible to squat non-residential buildings and live in them, or to squat residential buildings and not live in them. There are many buildings which contain a mixture of residential and non-residential spaces. Tenants and licensees (and anyone who had been a tenant or licensee, rather than just a trespasser) were supposed to be exempt from the new law, but how could a decision about someone's tenancy status be made by an untrained police officer standing on a pavement? How would the police decide what to do with mixed-use buildings? Would people actually be prosecuted for the new Section 144 offence? Or would it be used—like other criminal charges—purely as an excuse for the police to make arrests/ hand the building back to those claiming ownership, with the charges then being dropped?

Because of these uncertainties, a new version of the Handbook was not produced at the time of the new law. (NB: The Handbook only covers England and Wales. The legal system in Scotland is very different). In the Netherlands, human rights law was used very effectively against anti-squatter legislation, so there was some optimism about using it here too.

Some police forces were opposed to the introduction of new laws governing squatting, pointing out that the existing laws were quite adequate. They feared a situation where more of the burden (and the expense) of carrying out eviction-style operations would fall to the police, rather than being organised and paid for by the landowners. Others seemed to welcome the new powers and happily used them to tackle long-running squats on their turf. 
Now that some years have passed, it's easier to understand the effects of partial criminalisation.
One predictable outcome has been an increase in the number of non-residential buildings being squatted, and a massive decrease in the number of flats and houses being squatted. This has sometimes meant more people sharing bigger buildings, changing the nature of the squatting crew and community.

Another predictable outcome is that the public perception of squatting has changed. Many people believe that squatting has been completely criminalised, so education is needed. The need for education extends to the police themselves, who often display shocking levels of ignorance about the law, and often act as if they feel entitled to harass squatters.

It's much harder to squat now than it was in the past, and places seem to get evicted more quickly. Squatters have had to get their heads round the new law, and find ways to prove that they are not committing the new offence. This often involves proving that the building they are occupying is not ‘residential’. There's lots of information in the Handbook about how to do the necessary research and gather the correct evidence to prove to the police what the building is.
More than ever, squatters now need advice about how to handle the police (and the criminal law system), how to counter myths and misinformation, and of course the practicalities of making an ex-industrial/ commercial building fit for habitation.

Squatters have always demonstrated initiative and ingenuity in fixing up buildings, and carrying on long-overdue maintenance to make places warmer and more weatherproof. Nowadays, squats may not last as long, so the repairs are of a more temporary nature. 

On a practical level, non-residential buildings often have a ‘3-phase’ electricity supply—which can be quite daunting if you’ve only ever dealt with domestic systems before. A large chunk of the Handbook (over twenty pages!) is devoted to explaining how to safely carry out electrical work.

There is also the risk of being attacked by private security companies. An increase in unexpected/ unlawful eviction attempts has meant that more work is being done to fortify and barricade places. Again, the Handbook is full of helpful advice about doing this work to defend your space, and suggestions of ways to organise or join local squat-defence networks.

The other thing needed more than ever in the face of adversity is mutual aid. The more squatters and their supporters can organise to share information and help each other, the stronger our squatting movement will be. Practical support isn't just about responding to eviction resistance call-outs, it's also about supporting those who are left roofless afterwards, and encouraging people to form new crews and squat new places. It's about sharing skills and tips and resources. This Handbook is full of just that. It's been put together over the course of this year but also contains an accumulation of years worth of knowledge and experience, with contributions from lots of people, both current and former squatters.

The section about 'Dealing with the police' has been expanded. Other new features in this edition include a helpful Glossary at the back, which explains many legal terms. There's also, for  first time squatters, an alphabetical index to make it easier to find the pages you need. And some nice artwork spread out amongst the pages.
Whether you're thinking about squatting as a possible solution to your own housing needs, or interested in occupying space for a political/ community project, there is plenty of invaluable advice in the Handbook.  Available from the Advisory Service for Squatters, and via good/ anarchist bookshops, info-shops and distros.
