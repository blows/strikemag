UK nightlife appears to be limping with increasing pace towards a very unceremonious demise. Roughly 50 percent of venues have been shut down in the last ten years, late licenses are harder to come by and astronomical rent prices in places like London mean few could now afford to start a club. Added to this is the increased sanitisation of clubbing. This is most evident in the unholy marriage of nightlife and pop-up culture: clean, predictable, expensive and dull; the mall-ification of dance music. 

> Nightlife is important to marginalised/DIY communities because we have to create a safe space for ourselves until those communities feel safe enough to open up to others.

This model of nightlife is a far cry from previous purposes of clubs, which have historically positioned themselves somewhat antagonistically to the status quo. In their ideal form, they function as a semi autonomous space to bring like-minded people together. The queer clubs, the tiny bars that run noise nights every Thursday, the dingy basements with open minded programming and unlikely sound systems, and the clubs that consistently defied the prejudices of article 696: these places allow the people within them to create different worlds, worlds away from the various pressures, tastes and expectations of the rest of society. For many people, these spaces are something between a validation of selfhood and a lifeline. 

Undoubtedly, there is a whole lot of bullshit that happens in clubs, but in the current climate it is important to fight for the sort of venues outlined above. Clubs and bars provide physical space for communities, scenes and culture to thrive and in austerity Britain, nightlife is one of the few ways of making money from creative endeavours. They are crucial to so many cultural and social ecosystems. The (often appropriated) popularity of club culture and music such as drag, vogue, house and techno serves as a warped testament to the success of the club as a creative incubator. The kind of culture that is currently packaged and sold to straight, white, middle class kids in clubs that should be better conceptualised as Wembley style concerts (e.g. The Hydra in London) was grown in queer clubs with largely POC (People Of Colour) crowds, and facilitated by those physical spaces. 

The potential of clubbing to sustain new culture and marginalised communities is due, in part, to the fact that clubs draw certain crowds and may also exclude those that make their crowd feel uncomfortable. A fantastic article on the killing at the Orlando nightclub, highlighted the dichotomy between the world created at Latin Night at the Queer Club and the world outside: ‘Outside, it's another day in straight white America’. Clubs offer a chance to create your own utopia. One reason revered gay club Paradise Garage required membership was protection from those who might bring oppressive behaviour inside. On a more local level, Steph Seeks from Born N Bread explains it thus: ‘Nightlife is important to marginalised/DIY communities because we have to create a safe space for ourselves until those communities feel safe enough to open up to others.’ Clubs can be places where people can ‘become your truth’, in comparison with the ‘compressed version of yourself’ often necessitated by daytime spaces and activities. From a structural perspective, these parties allow for marginalised groups to reproduce themselves: events which challenge systemic dynamics gesture towards future political possibilities and at their most powerful, they subsequently empower people to continue with their daily struggles.

This is largely due to the fact that through their relative underground status, clubs represent the possibility of celebrating marginalised or alienated culture or identities on their own terms. Drag is a highly visual demonstration of this: London-based drag queen Victoria Sin explains it as a mocking performance of gender expectations, which weigh down especially on the queer community. As the ‘most common and traditional’ form of queer nightlife entertainment, it shows the role of queer spaces, and the activities they enable, in providing an outlet to recast the experiences of the outside world. The artist Angel Rose points to the traditional function of the nightclub as a place for marginalised groups to ‘commune and celebrate each other’. As many marginalised communities have been oppressed in the name of ‘morality’, it makes sense that spaces seeking to work outside of that matrix would have such importance. In her work, Angel conceptualises the dancefloor as disrupting what is perceived to be ‘appropriate’ during urban daytime, with a specific focus on how fat bodies navigate nightlife spaces. The consensual proximity with strangers (necessarily as imagined in a queer club, as ‘straight’ clubs involve too much nonconsensual bullshit), is described as ‘liberating’, where you don't have to apologise for the presence of your non-normative body.

This disruption of social norms both allows for the celebration of marginalised identity, and attempts to ‘disrupt’ the oppressions experienced by these crowds. In a 2015 interview with Noisey, Terre Thaemlitz spoke of her boredom with the concept of clubbing as escapism—an activity more in line with the privileged ‘liberal bullshit’ of PLUR (Peace Love Unity and Respect)—and instead spoke of the club as escape, as refuge from the outside world. Angel Rose draws on a similar opposition in her distinction between leisure—equated with escapism—and pleasure, a vital celebration of identity enabled by the physical space. Clubs can offer a temporary utopia: better understood as a collective effort by promoters, DJs and dancers to create a more perfect world than the one outside. When interviewing London femme, queer and QTIPOC collectives who played at the SIREN Synchronise party, I noticed the prevalence of the term ‘creating a space’. There is a sense that a certain type of clubbing has tangible, though amorphous edges. You can make something enveloping, even nurturing, and it is distinct from the external functionality of society. This kind of lens largely excludes leisure clubbing, in which everyday social dynamics are replicated, and in which the freedom felt is largely illusory, and instead turns to those spaces that work towards actual liberation, however temporary. 

> The depletion of venues sends a clear message that the kind of activities they host are not valued or supported, a further indication of London's approach to ‘unproductive’ creative or marginalised communities.

This distinction exists equally when discussing spaces which foreground music rather than identities. Just as parties like New York's Ghe20Gh0t1k continue to have huge influence on club music in North America and beyond, and FWD>> has enormously shaped UK dance music, DIY music scenes can provide a space for people to experiment, come together and support new development. The communal, DIY nature of these spaces is crucial. I spoke to Bristol-based techno producer Batu about his take on nightlife as both an artist and a promoter. He described his first experiences of clubbing as bringing ‘a massive sense of relief and comfort in being part of a space where people were seeking the same experience that I was.’ The theme of disruption could be carried further into the ethos behind his Timedance parties, the nights that accompany his label. He sees them as a reaction against the increasing commercialisation of dance music, but more crucially as an attempt ‘to fill a space for a specific idea of music’ he did not feel was being represented properly. 

It seems hardly surprising that at a time when we are fighting for all kinds of spaces, both public and private, clubs and bars are also under threat. Yet the current attack on nightlife spans much more than gentrification or an ideological attack on community spaces. The depletion of venues sends a clear message that the kind of activities they host are not valued or supported, a further indication of London's approach to ‘unproductive’ creative or marginalised communities. Yet this must be seen in contrast with the fact that darlings of neoliberalism such as the London night-club Fabric have also closed indefinitely, a display of the contradictory logic of Tory conservatism. The profit making capacities of commercial venues as such is pitted against Victorian morality and cuts to police and council budgets, and it appears the latter two currently dictate the terms. 

It is not entirely clear where we go from here. Organisations are trying to make headway with lobbying on these issues, but again, we have to question what form of nightlife they are fighting for. Berghain in Berlin was recently recategorised as a cultural institution and therefore gained a tax break. For many, state involvement in nightlife would remove much of its significance as a place where alternative modes of existence can prevail. On another level, it is crucial to remember the role that clubs play in accelerating the gentrification that will ultimately kill them—they play a crucial role in bringing more privileged people into areas they would not normally go, while also increasing the cultural capital and, therefore cost, of the property. The narrative around club closures needs to take into account the responsibility of venues for engaging with the communities they exist in, and to avoid treating working class areas of a city as a playground for more privileged people. The fact that clubs are cited by agencies such as Foxtons as an attractive draw for the area should alert us to the highly politicised nature of these spaces. It is telling that much of the dance music community only started raising their voices against gentrification when venues were being threatened—not when POC and working class communities were being priced out. 

Groups such as Resis'dance take an active role in supporting venues that are at risk from gentrification, such as The Silver Bullet in Finsbury Park—sadly now also closed. Support your local venues, especially the accessible, intersectional events—just because we want to keep the spaces does not mean we should accept the misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, ablism and racism that often manifests. Campaign to protect venues that are at risk of shutting down and write to local MPs asking for them to be given ‘asset of community’ status.
