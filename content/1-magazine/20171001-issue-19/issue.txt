Summary: 

Pedagogy is about the different ways of learning. This isn’t just about the traditional four walls of a classroom, but about learning from exposure, from walking down the street, from listening to each other and ourselves.
The question of pedagogy is political. We want to connect our needs and desires to reality. We want to raze reality to the ground by the forces of our collective desires. But this isn't just simple sixties Situationist stonerism—the old ‘kill the policeman in your head, man’—we need to learn how we go about doing it, together. How do you create the conditions by which desires for new worlds and new futures become realities?
