We are all prince charming
We all (sometimes) need rescuing.
We are all pussy riot. 
 
What do we want ? 
A  pussy riot
When do we want it?
Now
 
We demand
A jewel box jihad
Fru fru fighters
A fuck hole fracas
 
We demand
Someone to write a surrealist feminist manifesto
By putting the words pussy and riot into a thesaurus
and creatively composing composites from the two sets
When do we want it?
Now
 
What do we want?
A pussy riot 
When do we want it?
Now
 
We demand
A camel toed coup de tat
A spazm chasm revolution
Love alter insubordination
 
 
 
What do we want?
 A pussy riot
When do we want it 
Now
 
We demand
More
Gash guerrillas
More
Bush warriors
Rebellion in the republic of labia
When do we want it
Now
 
What do we want? 
A pussy riot
When do we want it?
NOW

This poem was written during the height of the fashionable outrage surrounding international activist sensation Pussy Riot. It was originally dedicated to Nadya and Masha and also a poet called Muhammad Al Aljami who was jailed in Qatar for 15 years for writing a piece promoting the Arab spring. Muhammad ‘s plight unsurprisingly got less attention in the media than that of the pretty white girls from the provocatively titled Pussy Riot. This poem is still in solidarity with him and anyone who stands up to the bullshit of patriarchal oppression in its many guises .For Nadia and Masha, ironically their prince charming wore a cloak cut from silver lining of the dark cloud that is sexism and examined hetronormativity.
