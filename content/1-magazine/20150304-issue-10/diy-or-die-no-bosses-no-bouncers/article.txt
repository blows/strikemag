In 2015 hating London has become a meme. Whether you resent the place for being expensive, overpriced or just... costing too much, with one “poor door” in and no conceivable way out, this city has become an easy by-word for fucked—the natural apex of everything that’s wrong with Rainy Fascism Island™. 

No more housing, just “stunning developments”; no more community, just “new destinations”. Hurling from motion sickness, green-gilled from the endless carousel of redevelop, re-stage, renege, we junk our evermore meagre wages or dole on whichever preferred numbing agent will momentarily block out the jagged skyline of luxury empties, sprouting up from Edmonton to Croydon. Less work for less pay, less space for less play. 

When it comes to places to play, in the literal sense, nowhere is this depressing trend towards enclosure and erasure more obvious than in the case of what are often called third spaces: community centres, music venues, pubs, social spaces, anywhere that’s not either home or work. Vicious property speculation, rampant development and political policing have created a perfect storm, and as a result, the barriers to entry for making your own culture, particularly for young people looking for alternatives, have grown higher and higher. Boarded up pubs are a norm and most cultural spaces are either prohibitively expensive, state-mediated art centres or mammoth venues named after phone networks—all sanitised to oblivion. These spaces send no message that culture can be produced as well as consumed, offer no opportunity to truly participate, no hint that there might be any options in-between a zero-hour contract and X-Factor stardom.

In London, remaining radical spaces cling on valiantly, providing much-needed examples of what’s possible. Both veteran centres like LARC and newer projects like The Common House in Bethnal Green show what is possible even within a small square footage, and their continued existence and support is completely vital. The archival material at 56a Infoshop, Crossroads Women’s Centre and the Feminist Library demonstrate the necessity of preserving our material and our stories. While British squatting and the autonomous spaces it has enabled over the years has never quite had the level of wider social acceptance seen across Europe, it does have a history (see the amazing Made Possible By Squatting exhibition of Autumn 2013) and whether in form or spirit, as model or legacy, it will have a future, if we build it. It’s either that, or the corner of a Wetherspoon’s and the o2 Arena.

Here’s the thing, though: outside of London, there has been a buzzing resurgence of self-organising music- and event-focussed social centres in the last few years. They hold low-cost-or-free gigs, performances and DIY cultural events, doing so in the spirit of mutual aid and cooperation that’s the antithesis of how most music spaces work. From cooperatively run venue-cum-bars like Wharf Chambers in Leeds, to ad-hoc DIY spaces like JT Soar in Nottingham— these spaces are rented, yes, but help to fill the ingenuity void left by criminalisation. In the few hot weeks of 2012’s summer of self-congratulatory Sports und Flags, when the law that criminalised residential squatting was passed, a small group of people got together to start talking about all this. We began to carve a paddle for shit creek, to ask, only rhetorically at first, why London couldn’t have a space like this. With our strength in numbers if we bought together everyone who’s interested, everyone who could benefit, why couldn’t we do this? At a nadir marked by so much patriotic back-slapping, we realised it was time to reinsert some idealism and some opportunity into the narrative. Instead of listing what’s wrong, impossible, improbable, too hard, or been tried, we asked, what can be done? The premise: how to respond to this crisis of space and create something resembling a long-term solution. DIY Space for London is the result.

We knew, throughout the ensuing explosion of excitement, and the flurry of benefit gigs, that a project to set up a radical non-squatted social centre had been tried before—as recently as ten years ago, with the Emma’s Project. Learning from those who have tried valiantly before was crucial. The stakes have risen—and the market values have skyrocketed—since then, but none of this stuff happens in a contextual vacuum, so we set about putting the hours in to speak to those who’ve tried in the past to do work like this around the UK. We set about a listening campaign to get in touch with social centres we admire across the world, from San Francisco (925 Gilman) to Bradford (The 1 in 12 Club) and started mirroring what could work here in our plan, picking the brains of everyone from Radical Routes to Disabled People Against Cuts.

Some of the organisers swirling around the project, which, while incorporated as a co-op, works more like an open network than a closed club, are musicians or campaigners with connections to other social centres outside of London. All are in some way unified by an interest in re-stating the link between the worlds of self-organised DIY (Do-It-Yourself) punk culture to those of radical left politics and community organising. As such, one thing we knew we wanted this radical social centre to include was the one thing that all the remaining spaces in London can’t be—a space suitable for live music. Why is this important, beyond our own selfish desire to peddle nostalgia for our preferred way of making and interacting with music?

Firstly, Benefits. A gig, rave, party, call it what you like, is still the quickest and easiest way to make a ton of money at a few days’ notice. As such, these kinds of spaces can back up struggles in brilliant and, when necessary, relatively discrete ways. There are working models for this across Europe and the world that lots of us have been lucky enough to visit, play in, stay at, work in.

Secondly, so much of the most potent and uncompromising germs of the punk rock imaginary (that we so mercilessly fetishise) emanate directly from the figure of The Squat. Many hundreds of people from the last thirty-five years can retell (misty-eyed and with a wry smile, you know the look) the common story of the slow drying up of emotional energy and resources associated with trying to create life and culture in forever temporary structures. What’s more, The Left is traditionally very bad at creating institutions, we’re all too often more reactive than proactive. But when it comes to mounting popular alternatives, different ideas, ways of working, living and being together, what could be more potent than a place you can actually visit? One thing we heard time and time again was that events are a reason to visit “political” spaces and find out how to become involved without the fear of “Who are you, why are you here?” and other kinds of social gatekeeping. We believe that radical affinities can blossom through social as well as political bonds.

We’ve spent the last three years building up energy with a wide variety of active people with shared views and various methods across London, working towards a physical space to store, grow and showcase alternatives. In February 2014 we became a legally-recognised, FCA-regulated IPS Cooperative Society. This means that any decisions about the money donated so far are made collectively, with a one-member one-vote system and an open membership model. Every penny so far has gone directly into a managed fund for the start-up costs of this project, a community Co-operative bank account. As of February 2015, we have just under £15,000 in donations, coming from individuals, groups, benefit gigs, zines, compilations and other events. All of this has been raised through these benefits, alongside a £1500 grant from Edge Fund. We all have an interest in fair and open decision making processes and are invested in the long-term future of a space like this. Money-wise, of course the phrase crowdfunding has come up. It’s something we’ve been generally resistant to because this isn’t about claiming equity, but working together to make something happen. We don’t believe being able to buy your way into a project means you should get a bigger say in how it works.

We hope this place can be more than just a great place to engage with to make music and culture, but also be a home for groups, projects, campaigns and networks that need more space; a gathering place for communities and a supportive environment for people looking to learn new skills; a hub for both DIY activity and social change work, to help accelerate the slow move of these two currents back towards each other. We’re creating a generally good, inspiring and productive place to be, make and do, and want all and any interested parties to get stuck into shaping what the space looks and feels like.

DIY Space for London has come into being and has been very much fuelled by the frustration of people who feel or have felt shat on in corporate gig venues, social centres or other cultural spaces through oppression or violence. We want to amplify marginalised voices, redressing this balance from the ground up in a positive and focussed way, carving out a conscious and productive way of working together. This is so that everyone who walks through the door has an equal chance of making an impact.

On the space hunt: we’ve been viewing properties for close to a year—all around town, from old pubs to business centres to warehouses, from Wapping to Rotherhithe to Hackney to Stoke Newington. We’ve been looking for somewhere close to accessible transport, so that it’s easily available as a resource to as many people as possible. What we have now realised is that there are far more properties out there available on five to ten year leases that sit just above our price bracket, but that would be perfect for a co-letting situation with other sympathetic groups and organisations. This is our new direction, with a preference for a shell space that we can make totally fit for purpose for everyone involved. Are you a group that needs some storage? A cooperative business looking to expand or get a cheaper deal on rent? Maybe you need an office or organising space, or you’re a radical artist looking for some space outside of the studio racket? Whatever you do, if you’d be interested in contributing to the rent on a larger building in exchange for being part of a hub for DIY activity and social change work, then we want to hear from you.
