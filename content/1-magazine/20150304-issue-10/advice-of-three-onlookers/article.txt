FREEE ON LENIN’S LETTER OF ADVICE

Artists and revolutionaries have this in common: they do not address themselves to ‘the people’. 
Revolutionaries divide the people, rigorously splitting its false unity into camps, classes, cadres and forces. Unity is not uniformly rejected but is deployed against itself: securing the unity of revolutionary forces is the prerequisite of dismantling the ideological and operational unity of the existing social formation designated by ‘the people’.

Artists cannot address ’the people’ as a whole without resorting to cliché not because ‘the people’, as an allegedly empirical social entity, only understands cliché but because ‘the people’ is an abstraction that provides the artist with no specific addressee, no specific material basis for dialogue, no specific subjectivity to unfold. 

Lenin’s ‘Advice of an Onlooker’ is a piece of writing that frames itself as both cut off from action and addressed to nothing but action. His words are not performative in the strict sense (e.g. “I now pronounce you husband and wife”, “I bet you a tenner”): the bond between language and action is not, in this case, internal to the structure of language itself. 

The agency he speaks of is not linguistic and yet his words are addressed directly to agents, and through them his text will be converted into action. This is the meaning of the word ‘advice’ here. 

Lenin’s speech act is an urgent linguistic intervention which places language within the actual revolutionary movement - the timely arrival of a letter can be vital to political events - while at the same time it attaches itself to modes of action that exceed spoken and written performatives. 

While liberal Habermasians protect the rational deliberations of the public sphere from the political activism that takes place on the street, Lenin’s ‘advice’ breaches the border between communicative action and direct action. 

In this sense, ‘advice’, like slogans, is a form of language that belongs to both action and argument. Lenin’s letter is an intervention in the world by a remote participant, taking part in events by being an onlooker that speaks. Advice is not a description of the world but a linguistic act that aims to change the world. Advice participates in events rather than merely talking about them because it calls for action. 

Lenin’s skill in writing a letter of advice to revolutionary activists is not a writing skill. Advice to radicals at the decisive moment is written well by successfully taking the temperature of social struggles. 

Our work is situated in places where reasoned debate leaks out into potentially violent confrontation

The language in our work calls for discussion, exchange and deliberation, on the one hand, and action, protest and force, on the other. 
Words here are not immunised from the world like Modernist poetry or legal jargon. Nor is rational argument jettisoned as a mere mask that power wears to legitimate itself.

Advice of Three Onlookers

We are writing these lines on February 4 2015 and have little hope that they will reach our global comrades in time as the magazine that will publish our ‘advice’ is printed bi-monthly. It is possible that our remarks will arrive too late since events are moving so quickly in so many countries at the same time. Nevertheless, we shall try to give our ‘Advice of Three Onlookers’ in the event that the probable decisive action of the workers, activists and students of the various struggles and occupations across the world will take place soon but has not yet taken place.

It is clear that all power must pass to the Commons. It should be equally indisputable for every revolutionary that the Commons (or the common ownership and control of everything - including the radical democratisation of the economy, which is the same thing) is assured of the utmost sympathy and unreserved support of anti-capital (the multitude, the precariat, the indebted, the dark matter, the cognitariat, the brutalised, the abandoned and the ruined) and exploited all over the world in general, to those ejected from their communities through global gentrification in particular, and among the populations subjected to austerity economics especially. These are all too well known and long demonstrated struggles against neoliberal capitalism.

What must be dwelt on is something that is probably not quite clear to all comrades, viz., that the passing of power to the Commons now means in practice armed insurrection. This would seem obvious, but not all have faced up or are facing up to this eventuality. To repudiate armed insurrection now would be to repudiate the chief slogan of our times (Austerity is Class War) and the slogans of the struggle for the Commons in general (Protest is Beautiful; Protest Drives History; Revolution is Sublime). 

But armed insurrection is a special form of political struggle, one subject to special laws which must be understood if our actions are not to be recuperated by big business or now corporate financiers like the revolutions of 1968. Karl Marx expressed this truth with remarkable saliency when he wrote that armed “insurrection is an art quite as much as war”. 

Of the principal rules of this art, Marx noted the following:

1. Never play with insurrection, never play at insurrection, never pretend that semiotics is the real form of insurrection, but when beginning it firmly realise that you must go to the end (if the insurrectionary forces do not take the armed struggle to its end then the enemies of insurrection will bring the revolution and the revolutionaries to an end).
2. Concentrate a great superiority of forces (superior numbers or superior skills or superior tactics) at the decisive point (the confrontation with power of the state cannot be avoided, disrupting a few shop windows will not suffice), at the decisive moment (this requires planning and a precise analysis of the balance of power as well as taking the temperature of the masses), otherwise the enemy, who had the advantage of better preparation and organization, will destroy the insurgents.
3. The insurrection must use ‘tactics’ or ‘bridges’ that demonstrate global finance as the beast that it is. ‘Credit’ might appear an agreeable concept but it is only a bridge towards ‘debt’.  Remember technology is not only the weapon of the financiers it can also be employed in the service of social change. Those that control the wealth of others through technology must learn what that same technology can do in the hands of the dissidents. We know that these individuals refuse to hedge their bets on the gluttony of bankers turning instead to financial moderation. 
Physicists too, need to be reclaimed, to work not for the insatiable minority but to join in the common goal of insurrection. There are no doubt socialist physicists among us and they will work for the common goal. Moreover culture must be commandeered and employed to form the new narratives of the revolution. 
4. Once the insurrection has begun, you must act (act, act, act! the time for talking is over!) with the greatest determination and by all means, without fail, take the offensive. Occupy always begins as an offensive gesture and then turns immediately into a defensive movement. The defensive is the death of every armed rising, just as acting reasonably is the death of every armed rising, and just as longwinded consensus is the death of every armed rising: we cannot secure the democratisation of everything by democratic means.
5. You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the moment when its forces are scattered. The forces of the state apparatus are only scattered for an hour or two until they are fully mobilised. But even when the state mobilises the police and the army it is never sufficient to prevent nation-wide or continent-wide action: you can take the enemy by surprise by popping up all over the place.
6. You must strive for daily successes, even if small (one might say hourly, now that social media speeds up all events), and at all costs remain the “moral ascendancy”.

Marx summed up the lessons of all revolutions in respect to armed insurrection in the words of Danton, which read like the words of Duchamp or Picabia: “audacity, more audacity, and always audacity”. Without revolution the struggle for the Commons is nothing but a hope; without armed struggle the revolution disperses and becomes neurotic; without audacity the armed struggle becomes mass sacrifice. 

Applied to the collective struggle global against capitalism in 2015, this means: a simultaneous offensive on the banks, the government offices, the European Commission, all the Central Banks across the world, the International Monetary Fund, The global corporations the global information networks and the financiers, as sudden and as rapid as possible, which must without fail be carried out digitally as well as by taking over buildings, not only by students, activists and other educated comrades but also by the working-class revolutionaries themselves, including economic migrants and asylum seekers from Poland to Ghana, from Ukraine to Argentina, from Greece to Afghanistan, from Spain to Iraq, and from Ireland to Nigeria, an offensive of the whole global agitariat, the concentration of a gigantic superiority of forces over the 1% super rich and the 10-20% non-worker owners generally and the 10% (perhaps less) hardline defenders of capitalist exploitation (the ideological defenders outnumber those who will take arms to preserve the political domination of big business and global finance but they will diminish in numbers as soon as the victory of the Commons is secured). The ‘reasonable’ middle-classes are also enlisted in this project; their expectation of modest homes and wholesome lifestyles is currently out of reach. They too now know what it is like to be displaced and marginalized, unable to access free state education and healthcare as they once could. 

Our three main forces - the workers, the students, and the activists - must be so combined as to Occupy without fail and to hold at the cost of any sacrifice: a) the global data centres and spy centres; b) the mobile phone infrastructure and counter-terrorism technologies; c) the roads, railways and bridges; d) above all, the power stations and mobile masts.

The most determined elements (our “shock forces” are young workers and angry activists, as well as the bravest of the students) must be formed into small detachments to Occupy all the most important points and take part everywhere in all important operations, for example:

To encircle and cut off city centres; to seize places of strategic power by a combined attack of workers, students and activists - a task which requires art and technology and brute force in a triple audacity.

To form detachments composed of the best workers, students and activists, armed with rifles and bombs and smartphones and laptops, for the purpose of physically and digitally Occupying the enemy’s “centres” (the riot police HQ, the ministerial buildings, the army barracks, the data centres, the information service offices, etc). Their watchword must be: “Rather perish to a man than let the enemy pass!”

Let us hope that if and when action is decided on, the leaders will successfully apply the great precepts of Danton, Duchamp and Marx. 

The success of each national revolution and the world revolution depends in each case on two or three days of fighting.
