On Tuesday 28th March 2017, activists from Plane Stupid, Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants and Stop Charter Flights - End Deportations stopped a mass deportation charter flight from going to Nigeria and Ghana. The scumbags at the Home Office rescheduled the flight and it left two days later. Whilst only half of the people were deported on the later flight, there is still a huge huge need to expose the violence, secrecy and corruption of this horrific process that disavows black and brown lives, rips families and communities apart and is wrapped up in dodgy dealings between the UK home office and MANY of its former colonies.

This three part series will explore mass deportation charter flights and situate them in its context.

Film made with the help from Movement for Justice By Any Means Necessary and other film makers, activists and inspiring people who are worst affected by immigration deportations.
