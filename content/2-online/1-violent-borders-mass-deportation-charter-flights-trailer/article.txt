Racism and xenophobia are on the rise, spurred along by the government’s rhetoric. Creating a ‘hostile environment’ for migrants is an explicit policy objective. Brexit has unleashed a surge of racist violence. Within this context the Home Office is able to deport people en masse and detain people indefinitely with little scrutiny or challenge.

On Tuesday 28th March 2017, activists from (link: http://www.planestupid.com/ text: Plane Stupid), (link: https://en-gb.facebook.com/lgsmigrants/ text: Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants) and (link: https://enddeportations.wordpress.com/ text: End Deportations) stopped a mass deportation charter flight from going to Nigeria and Ghana. The scumbags at the Home Office rescheduled the flight and it left two days later. Whilst only half of the people were deported on the later flight, there is still a huge need to expose the violence, secrecy and corruption of this horrific process that disavows black and brown lives, rips families and communities apart and is wrapped up in dodgy dealings between the UK home office and many of its former colonies.

This short documentary will explore mass deportation charter flights and situate them in its context. This film was made with the help from other film makers, activists and inspiring people who are worst affected by immigration deportations.
